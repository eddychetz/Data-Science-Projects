# Data-Science-Projects

## Project 1: Housing in Mexico

### About this Project

In this project, we'll work with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico through the real estate website [Properati.com](https://properati.com/). Our goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.

*Some of the things we'll learn in this project are:*

- How to organize information using basic Python data structures.
- How to import data from CSV files and clean it using the pandas library.
- How to create data visualizations like scatter and box plots.
- How to examine the relationship between two variables using correlation.

## Project 2: Housing in Buenos Aires

### About this Project

In the last project, we have learned data wrangling and visualization skills while examining the real estate market in Mexico. In this project, we'll build on those skills and move from *`descriptive`* to *`predictive`* data science. Our focus is still real estate, but now we need to create a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

*Some of the things we'll learn in this project are:*

- How to create a linear regression model using the *`scikit-learn`* library.
- How to build a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
- How to improve model performance by reducing overfitting.
- How to create a dynamic dashboard for interacting with your completed model.


## Project 3: Air Quality Nairobi

### About this Project

In this project, we'll work with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms [openAfrica](https://africaopendata.org/). We'll look at air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam; and build a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

*Some of the things we'll learn in this project are:*

- How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.
- How to prepare time series data for analysis.
- How to build an autoregression model.
- How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.

Time series models are not only important in public health; they're a key part of Financial Engineering. Plus, concepts we learn in this project will be helpful in Natural Language Processing.

## Project 4: Earthquake Damage in Nepal  

### About this Project

In this project, we'll work with data from [Open Data Nepal](https://opendatanepal.com/) to build a model to predict building damage from the [Nepal 2015 Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April2015Nepalearthquake). We'll work primarily with data from the Gorkha district, with additional examples from Ramechhap. _

Some of the things we'll learn in this project are:

- How to get data by querying a SQL database.
- How to build a logistic regression model for classification.
- How to build a decision tree model for classification.
- How to incorporate ethical considerations into your model building.

## Project 5: Bankruptcy in Poland  

### About this Project

In this project, we'll explore data collected by a team of Polish economists studying bankruptcy. Our goal is to build a model that can predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not.

Once we complete these project, we'll be able to:

- Navigate a file system from the Linux command line
- Load and save files using Python
- Address imbalanced data using resampling techniques
- Evaluate a model using classification metrics like precision and recall
