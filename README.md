## Project 1: Housing in Mexico

### About the Project

In this project, I'll work with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico through the real estate website [Properati.com](https://properati.com/). My goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.

*Some of the things I'll learn in this project are:*

- How to organize information using basic Python data structures.
- How to import data from CSV files and clean it using the pandas library.
- How to create data visualizations like scatter and box plots.
- How to examine the relationship between two variables using correlation.

## Project 2: Housing in Buenos Aires

### About this Project

In the last project, I have learned data wrangling and visualization skills while examining the real estate market in Mexico. In this project, I'll build on those skills and move from *`descriptive`* to *`predictive`* data science. My focus is still real estate, but now I need to create a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

*Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:*

- How to create a linear regression model using the *`scikit-learn`* library.
- How to build a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
- How to improve model performance by reducing overfitting.
- How to create a dynamic dashboard for interacting with your completed model.
